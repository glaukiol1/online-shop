            "description": "The Air Jordan 11 Cool Grey 2021' is the third-ever release of the popular, non-original colorway of Michael Jordan’s retro basketball shoe that originally debuted in 2001. The 'Cool Grey' colorway of the Air Jordan 11 is considered one of the most storied and influential Air Jordan shoes ever, despite the fact that it’s not an original colorway of the silhouette. First released back in March 2001, the 'Cool Grey' was later worn by Michael with the Washington Wizards. The Cool Grey look was replicated on the Air Jordan 3, Air Jordan 4, and Air Jordan 9 after the success of the Jordan 11. The colorway was brought back in December 2010, and again for this edition on the shoe’s 20th anniversary in December 2021. Details include a Cool Grey patent leather mudguard, Medium Grey synthetic nubuck upper, and white embroidered Jumpman on the collar. Additional details include white '23' on the heel, white shoe laces, and a white foam midsole. An icy translucent blue outsole completes the look of this iconic shoe.
